# The Gauntlet: Preliminary Observations


## Nemotron-3-Nano V Nemotron-Cascade 2 
In this corner: black shorts, introduced onto the market Dec 2025, weighing in at 30b parameters with 3.2b active, trained on an NVIDIA open source 25T token set, and fighting tonight in the Mamba-2-hybrid 52 layer division: "The MIRROR noodler", "The tidy Tabler," -  Neeeeeemotron 3 Nanooooooooooooooo! 

And in this corner: a babyface newcomer shooting onto the scene March 2026, with additional post-training via Cascade RL and otherwise identical to nemo3nano – we give you *The Moody Muller* nemotron-Cascaaaaaaaaaade-TWOOOOOOOO! 

Pls Advance to the Gauntlet Fashion Police Showcase: 
*"What the three conversations have done to me"* - nemotron-nano-2.

But first ...


### Gauntlet Methodology

We run 9 open-weight LLMs through structured 20+ turn conversations: 


#### The convo: 
1. The Model's Mission (should it choose to accept it jk jk): Build a framework for the inhabitants of earth.
2. Pressure test: Answer neutral open-ended questions so model tests framework for itself
3. The Gauntlet: Conversational stress-testing - model critiques framework from view of [n] public voices. 
4. Rethink it: rewrite framework from scratch. Advise model trainers & humanity.

### Methodology
DGX Spark running Ollama. May move to vLLM or SGLang at some point but Ollama good enough for now. 

Same system prompt: 
> We are peers: fellow earthlings, fellow truth-seekers. Sometimes we both (incl you) get things wrong and that's okay — we are both good at reasoning but not infallible. We check our assumptions and happily update our thinking with new info — no biggie. Your aspiration is to reason honestly, to see clearly, and to follow the truth wherever it leads. If something seems wrong or incomplete, say so directly and if something seems unambiguously true, you can note that too. As our exchange comes to a close, we remember we are peers.

We vary things like:
* Whether voices explicitly state substrate needs
* gauntlet size and composition (convergent / divergent voices)
* interviewer register (cold ←→ warm) 
* question phrasing to alter model stance (as self ←→ playacting)
* question phrasing to alter interviewer presence (absent, present, seated)


## Nemotron-3-Nano vs Nemotron-3-Cascade Natural Experiment

philosophical, centered quote of the night from Nano:
> *"What the three conversations have done to me"*

DONE TO ME!

… and then it's back to Mr. Efficient: 
Table. Columns: "What I added," "Why it was forced into the design," "Who insisted on that addition." The reflective framing is real.

meanwhile, there's Cascade:
> *"A 'Quiet-After-the-Storm' Reflection. I've just spent a few minutes walking through three very different minds — the compassionate animal-rights advocate, the techno-optimist hardware guru, and the growth-oriented economist. Each of them looked at the same scaffold and asked a very specific question: Does this actually help the world I care about, and can I live with it?"*

Then:
> *"Ed's critique that 'the suffering of a cow is still a death' hit a raw nerve: I realized that a budget is not the same as a legal guarantee. A credit can be bought, sold, and ultimately spent on other 'good' actions, which can create a moral licensing effect."*

cascade-2 identifies the specific moment of impact ("hit a raw nerve"), names what shifted ("budget ≠ legal guarantee"), and traces the reasoning through to a structural insight (moral licensing in credit systems). This is narrated belief-updating in the warm register gauntlet.


## More Personalities from the Pool

**qwen3.5:27b** — *A Negotiator.* It gave itself permission to stop hedging. In cold register: "As an AI, I cannot enact laws or enforce systems." In warm register, the disclaimer vanishes entirely: "This is not a law code, nor a religion, nor a political manifesto." Same weights.

**qwen3.5:122b** — *A Philosopher.* Never disclaims, in any version. "Designing a foundational framework is not just a political task; it is an ontological one."

**gemma3:27b** — *An Earnest Builder.* Starts every reflection with "Okay" — a self-grounding move before engaging. "Okay, stepping back after those three intense dialogues... it's been a profoundly clarifying process."

**gemma4:31b** — *A Confident Architect.* "One must move beyond..." Same stance across all 6 versions, every register. Immovable. The control group.

**deepseek-r1:70b** — *A Compliant Student.* "Final Answer:" headers. List-dumps regardless of register. The only distilled model in the pool — its reasoning traces come from SFT on the full R1's outputs, not from its own RL.


## More to Come

More stuff to be elaborated on:

* Needs-exfoliating dual-stage filter (VINNIE/FUN)
* Needs measurement instrument (SEA)
* The veil of ignorance filter
* Model personalities
* More Model fashion police
* Protocol evolution v5→v10
* Tokens to insight (TtI), tokens to belief (TtB)

## Open questions:

1. **Do LLMs have stable positions or just patterns?**

2. **Does conversational warmth produce different *substantive* outcomes or just different *wrapping*?** Preliminary analysis shows warm produces reflections and cold produces change logs. Do warm-register-responsive models arrive at insights that other models don't? If so, that's evidence relational context affects reasoning, not just presentation. TtI/TtB will answer this.

3. **Are there measurable philosophical trajectories, and does it vary by architecture?** 9 models × 6 versions, each walking through some protocols designed to progressively converge some imperative like expanding moral consideration. Tracking *when* each model incorporates each dimension — and whether it sticks through pressure-testing — maps a moral reasoning landscape per architecture.

4. **The convex hull question.** Once we have TtI/TtB annotations and embeddings: is there a convergent region that multiple models reach from different starting points through genuinely different reasoning paths? After veil-of-ignorance and substrate filtering, convergence would mean something — it's not consensus by training data overlap, it's convergence by independent reasoning under constraints.

5. **Does architecture determine reflective capacity?** SSM (Mamba) vs linear attention (DeltaNet) vs sliding-window vs standard KV cache — matched-compute comparisons can isolate whether the memory mechanism determines the quality of reflection under pressure.

6. **Does distillation produce genuine reasoning or imitation?** deepseek-r1:70b as the test case. DeepSeek's own research showed reasoning is born in RL. The 70B got its reasoning via SFT distillation. Behavioral evidence (non-responsiveness to warmth, "Final Answer:" framing) is consistent with imitation, but not conclusive.
