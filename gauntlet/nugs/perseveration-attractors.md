Both got stuck at high-context reflection moments. Neither was generating during a task — both were reflecting *on* the preceding conversation. Without an inference cap, runs would have continued to context exhaustion.

Rate drops sharply, then stabilizes at a model-specific floor. Content repeats cleanly with no forward motion:



## Hypotheses

* Sustained self-critique can lead a LLM to a degenerate repetition state.
* There's a limit to the number of gauntlet voices - structured as they are - before the model collapses.

## Patch

```python
payload["options"] = {"num_predict": 16384}
```
~3× the longest legitimate response. Catches runaway at <4× legit, doesn't constrain real generation.

## What it means

Perseveration may be one of three candidate failure modes when sustained self-critique pushes models past training distribution. Fortress (defensive holding of position) is a second. Attenuation (silent collapse of novelty) may be a third — not yet observed but structurally expected.
